A third case study has been added here in the form of pdf file , which is extended part of __Fault Diagnosis of Machines using Deep Convolutional Beta-Variational Autoencoder__, Which is not part of publication but we have shown it here to show the superiority of our DL model over other present baseline model.

PS : it will take some time to publish all codes here.
